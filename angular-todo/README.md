# Main 12

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
# Note:
If you run into issue "Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported" then run the command `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`, which is a workaround for the webpack issue (check [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532)).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g c component-name`('g' is shorter version for 'generate', 'c' is for 'component') to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
